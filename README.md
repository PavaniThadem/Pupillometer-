**Project Overview**

This project presents the development of a low-power, non-invasive diagnostic pupillometer designed to track pupil diameter in real time. The system aims to support clinical evaluation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, particularly by measuring sympathetic nervous responses through changes in pupil size.

The pupillometer utilizes a compact optical module with real-time imaging to measure subtle variations in pupil dilation and constriction. It is built to be portable and wearable, making it well-suited for integration into point-of-care diagnostic platforms or biofeedback applications.

**Key Features:**
High-precision pupil tracking using calibrated image capture

Real-time diameter measurement and digital feedback

Designed to detect pupillary light reflex (PLR) and autonomic reactivity

Optimized for low power consumption and wearable use cases

**Applications:**
Assessing neurological or autonomic dysfunction

Monitoring stress response in real-time

Integrating into wearable health devices for continuous diagnostics

Potential support tool in neuropsychological and ophthalmologic evaluations

**Role & Contribution:**
The project was conducted during graduate research, focusing on:

System block diagram and signal flow

Pupil detection method through frame-by-frame image processing

Defining clinical relevance of PLR for neuro-assessment

Conceptual development for future validation and hardware integration
