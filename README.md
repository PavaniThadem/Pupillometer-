Pupillometer-Based Diagnostic System for Early Detection of RAPD and Eye Defects

This project focuses on the development of a wearable, non-invasive pupillometer designed to detect Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) in patients. RAPD is a condition where the pupils show an asymmetric response to light, usually due to optic nerve or retinal dysfunction. Traditional diagnosis of RAPD is performed using a subjective method known as the swinging flashlight test. However, this method often lacks consistency and accuracy due to variations in examiner interpretation.

To address this challenge, this project aims to create a quantitative and objective tool that can track pupil responses in real time using a light stimulus and image processing system. The pupillometer captures and analyzes the diameter and constriction of each pupil frame by frame. The core feature of the system is its ability to grade RAPD severity from 0 (normal) to +4 (severe) based on how each eye reacts to light. This makes diagnosis more standardized and reliable.

A major highlight of the project is its ability to differentiate between actual neurological abnormalities and visual defects like cataracts or blurred vision. Conditions like cataracts can scatter or reduce the intensity of light entering the eye, mimicking symptoms of RAPD. To handle this, the system also includes a classification model that separates images of normal, blurry, and cataract-affected eyes to avoid misdiagnosis.

The device is built with user-friendliness and portability in mind. Its software includes automatic detection of pupil boundaries, measurement of radius changes, and decision-making algorithms that interpret the data without human bias. The system is designed to improve patient care by helping clinicians detect optic nerve or retinal issues early, monitor disease progression, and track treatment response more effectively.

My role in this project included designing the diagnostic logic, developing the grading system, and incorporating classification strategies to account for image distortions. I also contributed to the system architecture, validation strategy, and potential pathways for turning this into a clinically usable tool. This work bridges the gap between traditional manual diagnostic methods and next-generation optical health technologies.

In future development, this pupillometer can be adapted for mobile or wearable applications, integrated with machine learning models for real-time decision-making, and validated with larger patient datasets for clinical use. The ultimate goal is to make early diagnosis of optic nerve and retinal disorders more accessible, accurate, and scalable.
